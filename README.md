My personal dotfiles. In my opinion, [dotfiles are NOT meant to be forked](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/#dotfiles-are-not-meant-to-be-forked). That being said, this repository contains lots of useful things ([shell functions](https://github.com/lecoqjacob/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/zsh/functions.zsh), [scripts](https://github.com/lecoqjacob/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/covid-stats), [gitconfig](https://github.com/lecoqjacob/dotfiles/blob/master/git/gitconfig)) that you can add to your personal setup. As such, I encourage anyone that thinks these dotfiles look useful to try to understand them first and then copy the parts that stand out to them.

This repository uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.
