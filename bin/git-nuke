# Taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16740268/git-alias-to-delete-local-and-remote

# If you've stumbled across this, I would recommend installing `git-extras` instead.
# Then you can use `git delete-branch` as well as all the extra goodies that it comes with.

#!/bin/bash
set -eu

#
# git nuke <branch-name>
#
# Delete a branch (irrespective of its merged status) and
# remove from origin.

echo "Nuking $1 ..."

if git show-branch "$1" > /dev/null 2>&1
then
  git branch -D "$1"
else
  echo "No local branch to delete"
fi

git remote prune origin
if git show-branch "origin/$1" > /dev/null 2>&1
then
  echo "Deleting remote $1 ..."
  git push origin ":$1"
else
  echo "No remote branch to delete"
fi
